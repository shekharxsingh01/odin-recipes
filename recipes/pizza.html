        <p>Pizza is a popular Italian dish that consists of a round, flat base of dough topped with various ingredients such as tomato sauce, cheese, vegetables, and meats. It is typically baked in an oven until the crust is crispy and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Pizza can be customized with a wide variety of toppings to suit individual tastes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110°F)</li>
            <li>3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>    
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce or marinara sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Your choice of toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, etc.)</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional, for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>STEPS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups of flour, olive oil, sugar, and     salt. Add the yeast mixture and stir until a dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, gradually add more flour, a little at a time, until it comes together.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up as well.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. Divide the dough in half if you want to make two pizzas, or keep it whole for one large pizza. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
            <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, then add your desired toppings.</li>
            <li>If using a pizza stone, carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated stone in the oven. If using a baking sheet, simply place it in the oven. Bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired. Serve and enjoy!</li>
